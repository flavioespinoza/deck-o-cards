# deck-o-cards

## Homework

The purpose of this assignment is to figure a few things: your architecture and coding style, interpretation of requirements, and your creativity. We expect that this homework assignment will become a major conversation for our in-person interview.

Please create a javascript class that represents a deck of cards. Please include any methods or properties on the class that you think might be applicable to using a deck of cards. Create the UI for one game that will use this deck of cards. This game can be any game you like, even a game that you created just for this assignment

## Requirements

1. Create class that represents a deck of cards
1. Create an HTML/CSS UI for a game that interacts with this deck of cards class
1. Feel free to use a frontend framework :)
1. Please make sure there is a valid package.json file in the root of the repo
1. Upload this homework to a github repository
