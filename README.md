# deck-o-cards

## Homework

The purpose of this assignment is to figure a few things: your architecture and coding style, interpretation of requirements, and your creativity. We expect that this homework assignment will become a major conversation for our in-person interview.

Please create a javascript class that represents a deck of cards. Please include any methods or properties on the class that you think might be applicable to using a deck of cards. Create the UI for one game that will use this deck of cards. This game can be any game you like, even a game that you created just for this assignment
